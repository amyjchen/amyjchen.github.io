                Pixels from top to bottom represent the timeline of my life, replaced with red with increasing probability. The red starts from the point of the image that represents my current age, at which I am not conservative. Ends with me being conservative with 100% certainty (p = 1). Lifespan is based off of the current lifespan of an Asian-American woman in the US, 88.89 years.

                Pixels kept with probability p = 0, the approximated joint probability that all events that led up to us being the people that we are today would have occurred, given any slight change.*

                The time you got lost in the mall, that extra pause you took before crossing the street, the time your friend gave you their only cookie, the first time you noticed your parents arguing...all of it.
